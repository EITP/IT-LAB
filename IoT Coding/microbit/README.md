# What is a micro:bit?

# **Introduction**

This is a collection of Blocky-based and JavaScript-based that interact with micro: bit which can be used as IOT coding sample.

### Project Description

This Toolkit contains sample programs based on Micro: bit, online Blocky and JavaScript editor, including your own micro: bit Chip and other coming projects.

### Establish connection

Before design your own micro: bit coding, you have to establish connection via USB between the Micro: bit chip and PC.

### Micro: bit Chip Specification

Micro: bit is microcomputer board for STEM education. The 4x5 cm small circuit board is equipped with 25 LEDs, 2 buttons, 3 sensors of light/ temperature/ acceleration, BLE Bluetooth, and 25 I/O interface.
 
### How to use 

The micro: bit program can adopt Blocky programming method, that is, a program syntax or element is expressed as different shapes and sizes of blocks, and then the concept of stacking blocks is used to combine various program logics.

Open a web browser, such as Google Chrome, enter the URL https://makecode.microbit.org/, enter the micro: bit program editing interface, and you can start the micro: bit building block program journey. The JavaScript building block program editor combines blocks like Scratch when designing programs.
