### Following Tello EDU safety practices
The Tello EDU is best suited to indoor flight in a wide-open space. It is highly recommended that flying outdoors when there is no wind or a most, a light breeze. 

If flying outdoors, please be kindly reminded that monitor the weather and fly in a closed environment such as a fenced garden to avoid an incident.

If flying indoors, it is recommended using propeller guards for increased safety.
