# IT-LAB
This IT-Lab repository is open to publicly funded secondary schools participating in “IT Innovation Lab in Secondary Schools” Programme for uploading source codes and related materials after they have finished their projects funded by the Programme, which endevours to enable participating secondary schools to share their deliverables with each other to foster the atmosphere of IT learning in secondary schools. Secondary schools can also download the source code for reference in organising their own activities funded by the Programme.

The “IT Innovation Lab in Secondary Schools” Programme is implemented by the OGCIO under the existing “Enriched IT Programme in Secondary Schools” (EITP) to provide funding support of up to $1 million in the three school years from 2020/21 to 2022/23 for each publicly funded secondary school to upgrade their IT equipment and facilities and organise IT-related activities.
